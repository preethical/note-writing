Phototropism/Avadi on my mind

Avadi -- I learnt recently might have been an b/acronym for Armoured Vehicles and Ammunition Depot of India -- is where my grandparents lived.
The avadi of my mind wasnt home to the Heavy Vehicle Factory or the Automobile industry but to rice fields and ducks, endless coconut water 
and mangoes, and starlit nights with fireflies and toads.

There was this tree in my grandmothers house where I spent my summers. The garden it was in was overgrown - 
the kind of overgrown where the trees take over and it is dark in the undergrowth.The walls were covered in bouginvillea 
and the ground was covered in leaf litter. Any surface you looked at for more than a minute, was alive with insects. 
This tree was in the centre of garden - it's branches were bent and curved like an ox-bow lake which then shot straight back up again 
when it found a hint of sunlight. There were other trees in the garden, giving trees - an orange tree, which I would hit at 
with a stick three times my size for it to drop fruit, a lemon tree, with lemons for my grandmothers lemon rasam, 
a cashew tree which we were warned to stay away from because the fruit was poisonous (Cashews and their fruit contain this toxin Urushiol which is 
also found on poison ivy, it makes you itch). But this mango tree with its curved branch was the most palpable. 
It has curved itself to make room for me. It was home to countless ants and me.
I was largely an apprehensive child, not very physical, but on this tree, I would become a trapeze artisit, or a bat, hanging upside from the branch. 
I would swing on it and I would climb on to higher branches and get mangoes. It felt safe in this tree that had curved itself for me. 
There would be raw mangos on the ground which I would eat until my mouth was covered in ulcers at the end of every summer. 
In the afternoons, my mother would also sit around and watch me play. 
Over years I stopped visiting my grandparents house, work got in the way. The garden grew unfettered and abandoned by humans. 
The tree got larger and still gives every year - fruit, shade, home. 
It has been over fifteen years since I have gone to see that tree. 
My mother says it still exists. But not for much longer. 
But my parents are in the process of selling this house. 
My grandma lives with us now - she is frail and cannot move too much. I wonder if she thinks about the tree.
